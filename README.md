# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game
This is basic tic tac toe. With two versions to play: Play vs Player or Player vs Computer
The computer in this case does not pick the best move but instead picks a random empty space, therefore it is not very smart.
Addtionally, the computer will always be 'O'. 
The program pick randomly which goes first and keeps track of the length of each game as well as how many games have been played.
